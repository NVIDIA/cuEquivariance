You are responsible for the compliance with the terms of this Agreement by your authorized users. Any act or omission that if committed by you would constitute a breach of this Agreement will be deemed to constitute a breach of this Agreement if committed by your authorized users.
4.            Pre-Release. Software versions identified as alpha, beta, preview, early access or otherwise as pre-release may not be fully functional, may contain errors or design flaws, and may have reduced or different security, privacy, availability and reliability standards relative to NVIDIA commercial offerings. You use pre-release Software at your own risk. NVIDIA did not design or test the Software for use in production or business critical systems. NVIDIA may choose not to make available a commercial version of pre-release Software. NVIDIA may also choose to abandon development and terminate the availability of pre-release Software at any time without liability.
5.            Your Privacy: Collection and Use of Information.
5.1         Privacy Policy. Please review the NVIDIA Privacy Policy, located at https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/about-nvidia/privacy-policy, which explains NVIDIA’s policy for collecting and using data, as well as visit the NVIDIA Privacy Center, located at https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/privacy-center, to manage your consent and privacy preferences.
5.2         Collection Purposes. NVIDIA may collect certain personal information, such as your name and email address or those of your authorized users, and other information necessary to authenticate and enable you or your authorized users’ access to the Software.

NVIDIA may at any time and at its option, change, discontinue, or deprecate any part, or all, of the Software, or change or remove features or functionality, or make available patches, workarounds or other updates to the Software. Unless the updates are provided with their separate governing terms, they are deemed part of the Software licensed to you under this Agreement, and your continued use of the Software is deemed acceptance of such changes.
7.            Components Under Other Licenses. The Software may include or be distributed with components provided with separate legal notices or terms that accompany the components, such as open source software licenses and other license terms (“Other Licenses”). The components are subject to the applicable Other Licenses, including any proprietary notices, disclaimers, requirements and extended use rights; except that this Agreement will prevail regarding the use of third-party open source software, unless a third-party open source software license requires its license terms to prevail. Open source software license means any software, data or documentation subject to any license identified as an open source license by the Open Source Initiative (http://opensource.org), Free Software Foundation (http://www.fsf.org) or other similar open source organization or listed by the Software Package Data Exchange (SPDX) Workgroup under the Linux Foundation (http://www.spdx.org).

8.2         Your Ownership. Subject to the rights of NVIDIA and its suppliers in the Software, which continue to be licensed as stated in this Agreement, even when incorporated in your products, and the extent permitted by applicable law, as between you and NVIDIA, you hold all rights, title and interest in and to your services, applications and Derivatives you develop as permitted in this Agreement including their respective intellectual property rights.
9.            Feedback. You may, but are not obligated to, provide suggestions, requests, fixes, modifications, enhancements or other feedback regarding your use of the Software (“Feedback”). Feedback, even if designated as confidential by you, will not create any confidentiality obligation for NVIDIA or its affiliates. If you provide Feedback, you hereby grant NVIDIA, its affiliates and its designees a nonexclusive, perpetual, irrevocable, sublicensable, worldwide, royalty-free, fully paid-up and transferable license, under your intellectual property rights, to publicly perform, publicly display, reproduce, use, make, have made, sell, offer for sale, distribute (through multiple tiers of distribution), import, create derivative works of and otherwise commercialize and exploit the Feedback at NVIDIA’s discretion.
10.         Confidentiality. You may use confidential information only to exercise your rights and perform your obligations under this Agreement.

Each recipient of confidential information must be subject to a written agreement that includes confidentiality obligations consistent with these terms and must have a need to know for the Purpose. You will protect the NVIDIA Confidential Information with at least the same degree of care that you use to protect your own similar confidential and proprietary information, but no less than a reasonable degree of care. Confidential information includes, but is not limited to, the Software, including its features and functionality, Derivatives, and any results of benchmarking or other competitive analysis or regression or performance data relating to the Software.
