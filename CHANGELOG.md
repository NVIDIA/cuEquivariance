## Latest Changes

## 0.5.1 (2025-06-18)

This release includes improvements to triangle multiplicative update with torch.compile support and enhanced tuning configuration options.

### Added
- [Torch] `torch.compile` support for `cuet.triangle_multiplicative_update`
- [Torch] Optional precision argument for `cuet.triangle_multiplicative_update`:
  - `precision (Precision, optional)`: Precision mode for matrix multiplications. If None, uses TF32 if enabled in PyTorch using `torch.backends.cuda.matmul.allow_tf32`, otherwise uses DEFAULT precision.
  - Available options:
    - `DEFAULT`: Use default precision setting of `triton.language.dot`
    - `TF32`: Use TensorFloat-32 precision
    - `TF32x3`: Use TensorFloat-32 precision with 3x accumulation
    - `IEEE`: Use IEEE 754 precision

### Improved
- [Torch] Enhanced tuning configuration for `cuet.triangle_multiplicative_update` with support for multi-process tuning. Our tuning modes:
  - **Quick testing**: Default configuration where tuning configs, if existent, are looked-up. If not, then falls back to default kernel parameters. No tuning is performed.
  - **On-Demand tuning**: Set `CUEQ_TRITON_TUNING_MODE = "ONDEMAND"` to auto-tune for new shapes encountered on first run (may take several minutes)
  - **AOT tuning**: Set `CUEQ_TRITON_TUNING_MODE = "AOT"` to perform full ahead-of-time tuning for optimal performance **(may take several hours)**
  - **Ignore cache**: Set `CUEQ_TRITON_IGNORE_EXISTING_CACHE` to ignore both the default settings that come with the package and any user-local settings previously saved with AOT/ONDEMAND tuning. May be used to regenerate optimal settings for a particular setup.
  - **Cache directory**: Set `CUEQ_TRITON_CACHE_DIR` to specify where tuning configurations are stored. Default location is `${HOME}/.cache/cuequivariance-triton`. **Note**: When running in containers where `$HOME` is inside the container (typically `/root`), tuning changes may be lost on container restart unless the container is committed or a persistent cache directory is specified.

### Fixed
- [Torch] Fixed torch.compile compatibility issues with triangle multiplicative update
- [Torch] Tuning issues for `cuet.triangle_multiplicative_update` with multiple processes.

### Limitations
- PyTorch does not currently bundle the latest Triton version as pytorch-triton. As a result, Blackwell GPU users may occasionally experience hangs or instability during model execution. Users may attempt installation with the latest Triton from source at their own risk. We are monitoring this issue and will remedy as soon as possible.
- [Torch] Tuning for `cuet.triangle_multiplicative_update` is always performed for GPU-0 and may not be the optimal setting for all GPUs in a heterogenous multi-GPU setting

## 0.5.0 (2025-06-10)

This release introduces `triangle_attention` and `triangle_multiplicative_update`.
This is the last release with cuda11 support. In the next release we will drop cuda11.

### Added
- [Torch] Add `cuet.triangle_attention`
- [Torch] Add `cuet.triangle_multiplicative_update`
- [JAX] Add `cuex.experimental.indexed_linear`. Note that this function is not working with cuda11 because it requires cuBLAS 12.5.
- [Torch/JAX] Add argument `simplify_irreps3: bool = False` to `cue.descriptors.channelwise_tensor_product`
- [Torch/JAX] Add method `permute_inputs` to `SegmentedPolynomial`

### Improved
- [Torch/JAX] In some settings, accelerate the CUDA kernel for uniform 1d segmented polynomials (like symmetric contraction and channelwise tensor product). While most operation speeds are unchanged, we observe up to 2x speedup in some cases.

### Limitations
- PyTorch does not currently bundle the latest Triton version as pytorch-triton. As a result, Blackwell GPU users may occasionally experience hangs or instability during model execution. Users may attempt installation with the latest Triton from source at their own risk. We are monitoring this issue and will remedy as soon as possible.

### Documentation
- `cuet.triangle_multiplicative_update`: Auto-tuning behavior can be controlled through environment variables:
  - Default: Full Ahead-of-Time (AOT) auto-tuning enabled for optimal performance **(may take several hours)**
  - Quick testing: Set `CUEQ_DISABLE_AOT_TUNING = 1` and `CUEQ_DEFAULT_CONFIG = 1` to disable all tuning
  - On-Demand tuning: `CUEQ_DISABLE_AOT_TUNING = 1`, auto-tunes for new shapes encountered on first run. (may take several minutes)
  - Note: When using Docker with default or on-demand tuning enabled, commit the container to persist tuning changes
  - Note: When running in a multi-GPU setup, we recommend setting `CUEQ_DISABLE_AOT_TUNING = 1` and `CUEQ_DEFAULT_CONFIG = 1`.

## 0.4.0 (2025-04-25)

This release introduces some changes to the API, it introduce the class `cue.SegmentedPolynomial` (and corresponding counterparts) which generalizes the notion of segmented tensor product by allowing to construct non-homogeneous polynomials.

### Added
- [Torch] `cuet.SegmentedPolynomial` module giving access to the indexing features of the uniform 1d kernel
- [Torch/JAX] Add full support for float16 and bfloat16
- [Torch/JAX] Class `cue.SegmentedOperand`
- [Torch/JAX] Class `cue.SegmentedPolynomial`
- [Torch/JAX] Class `cue.EquivariantPolynomial` that contains a `cue.SegmentedPolynomial` and the `cue.Rep` of its inputs and outputs
- [Torch/JAX] Add caching for `cue.descriptor.symmetric_contraction`
- [Torch/JAX] Add caching for `cue.SegmentedTensorProduct.symmetrize_operands`
- [JAX] ARM config support
- [JAX] `cuex.segmented_polynomial` and `cuex.equivariant_polynomial`
- [JAX] Advanced Batching capabilities, each input/output of a segmented polynomial can have multiple axes and any of those can be indexed.
- [JAX] Implementation of the Dead Code Elimination rule for the primitive `cuex.segmented_polynomial`

### Breaking Changes
- [Torch/JAX] Rename `SegmentedTensorProduct.flop_cost` to `flop`
- [Torch/JAX] Rename `SegmentedTensorProduct.memory_cost` to `memory`
- [Torch/JAX] Removed `IrrepsArray` in favor of `RepArray`
- [Torch/JAX] Change folder structure of cuequivariance and cuequivariance-jax. Now the main subfolders are `segmented_polynomials` and `group_theory`
- [Torch/JAX] Deprecate `cue.EquivariantTensorProduct` in favor of `cue.EquivariantPolynomial`. The later will have a limited list of features compared to `cue.EquivariantTensorProduct`. It does not contain `change_layout` and the methods to move the operands. Please open an issue if you need any of the missing methods.
- [Torch/JAX] The descriptors return `cue.EquivariantPolynomial` instead of `cue.EquivariantTensorProduct`
- [Torch/JAX] Change `cue.SegmentedPolynomial.canonicalize_subscripts` behavior for coefficient subscripts. It transposes the coefficients to be ordered the same way as the rest of the subscripts.
- [Torch] To reduce the size of the so library, we removed support of math dtype fp32 when using IO dtype fp64 in the case of the fully connected tensor product. (It concerns `cuet.FullyConnectedTensorProduct` and `cuet.FullyConnectedTensorProductConv`). Please open an issue if you need this feature.

### Fixed
- [Torch/JAX] `cue.SegmentedTensorProduct.sort_indices_for_identical_operands` was silently operating on STP with non scalar coefficient, now it will raise an error to say that this case is not implemented. We should implement it at some point.


## 0.3.0 (2025-03-05)

The main changes are:
1. [JAX] New JIT Uniform 1d kernel with JAX bindings
   1. Computes any polynomial based on 1d uniform STPs
   2. Supports arbitrary derivatives
   3. Provides optional fused scatter/gather for the inputs and outputs
   4. 🎉 We observed a ~3x speedup for MACE with cuEquivariance-JAX v0.3.0 compared to cuEquivariance-Torch v0.2.0 🎉
2. [Torch] Adds torch.compile support
3. [Torch] Beta limited Torch bindings to the new JIT Uniform 1d kernel 
   1. enable the new kernel by setting the environement variable `CUEQUIVARIANCE_OPS_USE_JIT=1`
4. [Torch] Implements scatter/gather fusion through a beta API for Uniform 1d 
   1. this is a temporary API that will change, `cuequivariance_torch.primitives.tensor_product.TensorProductUniform4x1dIndexed`

### Breaking Changes
- [Torch/JAX] Removed `cue.TensorProductExecution` and added `cue.Operation` which is more lightweight and better aligned with the backend.
- [JAX] In `cuex.equivariant_tensor_product`, the arguments `dtype_math` and `dtype_output` are renamed to `math_dtype` and `output_dtype` respectively. This change adds consistency with the rest of the library.
- [JAX] In `cuex.equivariant_tensor_product`, the arguments `algorithm`, `precision`, `use_custom_primitive` and `use_custom_kernels` have been removed. This change avoids a proliferation of arguments that are not used in all implementations. An argument `impl: str` has been added instead to select the implementation.
- [JAX] Removed `cuex.symmetric_tensor_product`. The `cuex.tensor_product` function now handles any non-homogeneous polynomials.
- [JAX] The batching support (`jax.vmap`) of `cuex.equivariant_tensor_product` is now limited to specific use cases.
- [JAX] The interface of `cuex.tensor_product` has changed. It now takes a list of `tuple[cue.Operation, cue.SegmentedTensorProduct]` instead of a single `cue.SegmentedTensorProduct`. This change allows `cuex.tensor_product` to execute any type of non-homogeneous polynomials.
- [JAX] Removed `cuex.flax_linen.Linear` to reduce maintenance burden. Use `cue.descriptor.linear` together with `cuex.equivariant_tensor_product` instead.
```python
e = cue.descriptors.linear(input.irreps, output_irreps)
w = self.param(name, jax.random.normal, (e.inputs[0].dim,), input.dtype)
output = cuex.equivariant_tensor_product(e, w, input)
```

### Fixed
- [Torch/JAX] Fixed `cue.descriptor.full_tensor_product` which was ignoring the `irreps3_filter` argument.
- [Torch/JAX] Fixed a rare bug with `np.bincount` when using an old version of numpy. The input is now flattened to make it work with all versions.
- [Torch] Identified a bug in the CUDA kernel and disabled CUDA kernel for `cuet.TransposeSegments` and `cuet.TransposeIrrepsLayout`.

### Added
- [Torch/JAX] Added `__mul__` to `cue.EquivariantTensorProduct` to allow rescaling the equivariant tensor product.
- [JAX] Added JAX Bindings to the uniform 1d JIT kernel. This kernel handles any kind of non-homogeneous polynomials as long as the contraction pattern (subscripts) has only one mode. It handles batched/shared/indexed input/output. The indexed input/output is processed through atomic operations.
- [JAX] Added an `indices` argument to `cuex.equivariant_tensor_product` and `cuex.tensor_product` to handle the scatter/gather fusion.
- [Torch] Beta limited Torch bindings to the new JIT Uniform 1d kernel (enable the new kernel by setting the environement variable `CUEQUIVARIANCE_OPS_USE_JIT=1`)
- [Torch] Implements scatter/gather fusion through a beta API for Uniform 1d (this is a temporary API that will change, `cuequivariance_torch.primitives.tensor_product.TensorProductUniform4x1dIndexed`)


## 0.2.0 (2025-01-24)

### Breaking Changes

- Minimal Python version is now 3.10 in all packages.
- `cuet.TensorProduct` and `cuet.EquivariantTensorProduct` now require inputs to be of shape `(batch_size, dim)` or `(1, dim)`. Inputs of dimension `(dim,)` are no longer allowed.
- `cuex.IrrepsArray` is now an alias for `cuex.RepArray`.
- `cuex.RepArray.irreps` and `cuex.RepArray.segments` are no longer functions. They are now properties.
- `cuex.IrrepsArray.is_simple` has been replaced by `cuex.RepArray.is_irreps_array`.
- The function `cuet.spherical_harmonics` has been replaced by the Torch Module `cuet.SphericalHarmonics`. This change enables the use of `torch.jit.script` and `torch.compile`.

### Added

- Added experimental support for `torch.compile`. Known issue: the export in C++ is not working.
- Added `cue.IrrepsAndLayout`: A simple class that inherits from `cue.Rep` and contains a `cue.Irreps` and a `cue.IrrepsLayout`.
- Added `cuex.RepArray` for representing an array of any kind of representations (not only irreps as was previously possible with `cuex.IrrepsArray`).

### Fixed

- Added support for empty batch dimension in `cuet` (`cuequivariance_torch`).
- Moved `README.md` and `LICENSE` into the source distribution.
- Fixed `cue.SegmentedTensorProduct.flop_cost` for the special case of 1 operand.

### Improved

- Removed special case handling for degree 0 in `cuet.SymmetricTensorProduct`.

## 0.1.0 (2024-11-18)

- Beta version of cuEquivariance released.
