Segmented Tensor Product
========================

In this example, we are showing how to create a custom tensor product descriptor and execute it.
First, we need to import the necessary modules.

.. jupyter-execute::

   import itertools
   import numpy as np
   import torch
   import jax
   import jax.numpy as jnp

   import cuequivariance as cue
   import cuequivariance_torch as cuet  # to execute the tensor product with PyTorch
   import cuequivariance_jax as cuex    # to execute the tensor product with JAX

Basic Tools
-----------

Creating a tensor product descriptor using the :class:`cue.SegmentedTensorProduct <cuequivariance.SegmentedTensorProduct>` class.

.. jupyter-execute::

   d = cue.SegmentedTensorProduct.from_subscripts("a,ia,ja+ij")
   print(d.to_text())

This descriptor has 3 operands.

.. jupyter-execute::

   d.num_operands

Its coefficients have indices "ij".

.. jupyter-execute::

   d.coefficient_subscripts

Adding segments to the two operands.

.. jupyter-execute::

   d.add_segment(0, (200,))
   d.add_segments(1, [(3, 100), (5, 200)])
   d.add_segments(2, [(1, 200), (1, 100)])
   print(d.to_text())

Observing that "j" is always set to 1, squeezing it.

.. jupyter-execute::

   d = d.squeeze_modes("j")
   print(d.to_text())

Adding paths between the segments.

.. jupyter-execute::

   d.add_path(0, 1, 0, c=np.array([1.0, 2.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]))
   print(d.to_text())

Flattening the index "i" of the coefficients.

.. jupyter-execute::

   d = d.flatten_modes("i")
   # d = d.flatten_coefficient_modes()
   print(d.to_text())

Equivalently, :meth:`flatten_coefficient_modes <cuequivariance.SegmentedTensorProduct.flatten_coefficient_modes>` can be used.



Equivariant Linear Layer
------------------------

Now, we are creating a custom tensor product descriptor that represents the tensor product of the two representations. See :ref:`tuto_irreps` for more information on irreps.

.. jupyter-execute::

   irreps1 = cue.Irreps("O3", "32x0e + 32x1o")
   irreps2 = cue.Irreps("O3", "16x0e + 48x1o")

The tensor product descriptor is created step by step. First, we are creating an empty descriptor given its subscripts.
In the case of the linear layer, we have 3 operands: the weight, the input, and the output.
The subscripts of this tensor product are "uv,iu,iv" where "uv" represents the modes of the weight, "iu" represents the modes of the input, and "iv" represents the modes of the output.

.. jupyter-execute::

   d = cue.SegmentedTensorProduct.from_subscripts("uv,iu,iv")
   d

Each operand of the tensor product descriptor has a list of segments.
We can add segments to the descriptor using the :meth:`add_segment <cuequivariance.SegmentedTensorProduct.add_segment>` method.
We are adding the segments of the input and output representations to the descriptor.

.. jupyter-execute::

   for mul, ir in irreps1:
      d.add_segment(1, (ir.dim, mul))
   for mul, ir in irreps2:
      d.add_segment(2, (ir.dim, mul))

   d

Enumerating all the possible pairs of irreps and adding weight segements and paths between them when the irreps are the same.

.. jupyter-execute::

   for (i1, (mul1, ir1)), (i2, (mul2, ir2)) in itertools.product(
      enumerate(irreps1), enumerate(irreps2)
   ):
      if ir1 == ir2:
         d.add_path(None, i1, i2, c=1.0)

   d

Printing the paths.

.. jupyter-execute::

      d.paths


Normalizing the paths for the last operand such that the output is normalized to variance 1.

.. jupyter-execute::

   d = d.normalize_paths_for_operand(-1)
   d.paths

As we can see, the paths coefficients have been normalized.

Now we are creating a tensor product from the descriptor and executing it. In PyTorch, we can use the :class:`cuet.TensorProduct <cuequivariance_torch.TensorProduct>` class.

.. jupyter-execute::

   linear_torch = cuet.TensorProduct(d, use_fallback=True)
   linear_torch


Now we can execute the linear layer with random input and weight tensors.

.. jupyter-execute::

   w = torch.randn(1, d.operands[0].size)
   x1 = torch.randn(3000, irreps1.dim)

   x2 = linear_torch(w, x1)

   assert x2.shape == (3000, irreps2.dim)

Now we are verifying that the output is well normalized.

.. jupyter-execute::

   x2.var()



In JAX, we can use the :func:`cuex.segmented_polynomial <cuequivariance_jax.segmented_polynomial>` function.

.. jupyter-execute::

   w = jax.random.normal(jax.random.key(0), (d.operands[0].size,))
   x1 = jax.random.normal(jax.random.key(1), (3000, irreps1.dim))

   [x2] = cuex.segmented_polynomial(
      cue.SegmentedPolynomial.eval_last_operand(d),
      [w, x1],
      [jax.ShapeDtypeStruct((3000, irreps2.dim), jnp.float32)],
   )

   assert x2.shape == (3000, irreps2.dim)
   x2.var()
